# Hi, I'm Dan 👋

I portray myself as a web developer, passionate about building slick user interfaces. I tend to overstep my duties sometimes, so not your typical consultant. I enjoy interacting with other human beings passionate about fresh and dynamic businesses.

I like to make magic happen with code 🧙‍♂️
